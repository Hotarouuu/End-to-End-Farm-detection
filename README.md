# Machine Learning Engineering Project - Crop Detection

## Introduction

This project was developed to build an end to end machine learning solution focused on crop prediction. The goal is to recommend the most promising crop type based on soil parameters, supporting more informed agricultural decisions.

The dataset is intentionally simple. The focus of this project is not model performance or complex data, but the design of a robust and well structured architecture that follows best practices across the entire machine learning lifecycle.

The project covers the complete pipeline, from exploratory data analysis and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The final model is served through a Dockerized RESTful API, demonstrating how to organize, containerize, and expose a machine learning system in a production ready local environment without relying on cloud infrastructure.
